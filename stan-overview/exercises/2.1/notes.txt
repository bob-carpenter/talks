Stan Workflow - tools ShinyStan and BayesPlot

- class exercise part 1: program the model to fit data

  A. model to fit outcomes from 1 roll of D6
  B. model to fit outcomes from 3 rolls of a fair D6

- class exercise part 2: predictive posterior

  A. add post predictive to model, log_lik to model
  B. run Bayesplot

- class exercise part 3:  visualization

Stan programming language excercises

* recursive functions

* efficient coding
    + data block: declarations only
    + transformed data block:  1x
    + parameter block: param declarations only - can you assign to params in local block?  are local blocks allowed?
    + transformed parameters, model block:  difference between local / global variables
    + generated quantities block:  restrictions on variables

Exercises (drawn form Forums?)

1. code that doesn't compile - fix
2. code that runs slowly - fix
