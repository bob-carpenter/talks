exercises: Generative Story / Stan Workflow

Exercises part 1: MC simulation in Stan

- example: Stan program to generate Magic 8-Ball responses.
  1000 draws == pre-generated script
  answer shows up in stanfit
  print statements on console

- class exercise part 1: program the generative process in Stan

  A.  generate rolls from a fair D6
  B.  generate 3 rolls from a fair D6
  C.  generate best 3 out of 4 rolls from a fair D6

Exercises part 2: MCMC simulation in Stan

- curse of dimensionality


generate from normal, 4 degrees of freedom, cauchy
what do draws look like for tails?


- class exercise part 2: program the model to fit data from this process

  A. model to fit outcomes from 1 roll of D6
  B. model to fit outcomes from 3 rolls of a fair D6

- class exercise part 3: predictive posterior

  A. add post predictive to model, log_lik to model
  B. run Bayesplot

- class exercise part 4:  checking model fit
